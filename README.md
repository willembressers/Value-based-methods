# Value-Based Methods

![Trained Agents][image1]

This repository contains material related to Udacity's Value-based Methods course.

## Table of Contents

### Tutorials

The tutorials lead you through implementing various algorithms in reinforcement learning.  All of the code is in PyTorch (v0.4) and Python 3.

* [Deep Q-Network](https://github.com/udacity/Value-based-methods/tree/main/dqn): Explore how to use a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to navigate a space vehicle without crashing.

### Labs / Projects

The labs and projects can be found below.  All of the projects use rich simulation environments from [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

* [Navigation](https://github.com/udacity/Value-based-methods/tree/main/p1_navigation): In the first project, you will train an agent to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.

### Resources

* [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/udacity/Value-based-methods/tree/main/cheatsheet): You are encouraged to use [this PDF file](https://github.com/udacity/Value-based-methods/blob/main/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.pdf) to guide your study of reinforcement learning. 

## OpenAI Gym Benchmarks

### Box2d
- `LunarLander-v2` with [Deep Q-Networks (DQN)](https://github.com/udacity/Value-based-methods/blob/main/dqn/solution/Deep_Q_Network_Solution.ipynb) | solved in 1504 episodes

## Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
	
2. ---Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).---
	
3. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/willembressers/Value-based-methods.git
cd Value-based-methods/python
pip install .
```

4. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```
Start the notebook
```bash
cd ..
jupyter notebook
```

5. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu.
